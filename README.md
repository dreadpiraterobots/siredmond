# SirEdmond
A fast and efficient way to interact with Microsoft security advisory data.

If you want to know:
- How many critical CVEs did Microsoft publish on the most recent Patch Tuesday?
- Which vulns did Microsoft publish in 2023 and tag as exploited in the wild?
- How often does Microsoft assign a proprietary severity to a vulnerability which differs from the severity suggested by the CVSS vector?
- Who is most often credited with reporting critical vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel?

or if you want to:
- Extract information from the CVRF into CSV, JSON, HTML etc.
- Explore Microsoft security advisory data without reading XML files or relying on the MSRC web UI.

then SirEdmond might just be what you're looking for.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of these aren't implemented yet. I'll remove this note once it's no longer needed.
